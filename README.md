## How to use
This program utilizes the [BulletinBoard](https://github.com/YShoji-HEP/BulletinBoard) data accumulation framework. Prior to execution, ensure the BulletinBoard server is operational and that its address and port are correctly configured. Data generated by this program can then be accessed by client applications in Mathematica and Python.

Compilation requires the Rust compiler. Configuration of parameters and methods is achieved by commenting/uncommenting relevant lines within `src/main.rs`.
